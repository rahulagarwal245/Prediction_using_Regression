🔍 Prediction Using Regression

This repository contains a collection of regression-based machine learning projects implemented using Python (Jupyter Notebooks). The objective is to build, evaluate, and interpret predictive models using:

Linear Regression,
Multiple Linear Regression,
Logistic Regression.

Each notebook applies regression techniques to distinct, real-world datasets spanning domains such as finance, healthcare, retail, and more. The focus is on model development, accuracy evaluation, and data-driven insights.



📁 Projects Included:

Bank Campaign Analysis,
Loan Sanction Prediction,
McDonald's Sales Forecasting,
Parkinson’s Disease Detection,
Salary Prediction,
Walmart Weekly Sales Forecasting,



📊 Tools & Techniques:

Data preprocessing & EDA,
Model training and evaluation,
Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn,
StatsModel for machine learning implementation.
